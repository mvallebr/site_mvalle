I have just learned how to create a blog using [Jekyll][jekyll-gh]. My first idea was to write posts to medium, but it's important to me to write posts using [Markdown language](https://www.markdownguide.org/), so I have opted for using Jekyll with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with my custom domain.

What do you? Was the result acceptable? You can find the source code of this website in [my github project page](https://github.com/mvallebr/site_mvalle).

I wish I could customise this more, and still keeping the updates from new versions easy, but for now this is enough and I want to focus on content, not on appearance, so hopefully the visual looks good enough. If you're seeing this on a later time hopefully the visual will be a little bit improved?

What I loved about this is how easy it is to write a new post: I still can use my prefered markdown editor, version everything in a git repo, and all I have to do to create a new post, which can include images, is creating the images in `assets/img` folder and then a post in `_posts` folder. Once I push the commit to master, github automatically deploys and hosts it for me. Nice, uh?

And just to prove that this works, here it comes an image - a photo I took on Lego Land recently.

Do you have suggestions for improvements on how to host a blog or publishing posts? Any trade-offs? Please leave a comment below, it will be appreciated!
