The mindset towards hierarchy has been changing fast in the last decades. If you saw my last article, [Your team at work and the american civil war](/personal/2023/09/02/your-team-and-the-american-civil-war.html), it will be easier to understand why I think we should change our mental model about how to organize the teams at work. In this article, I will attack specifically the mental model regarding hierarchy.

I start by giving context on the changes that have been happening in the last decades, then discussing about what is the direction the software market is taking and whether it's the right one, to finally give you my opinion on what we should change in our work environments.

## A little bit of history

Back in the day, when I left college, working as a software engineer was much more problematic, in average, in any organization, than what I see in the market today (as of 2023). The big enemy at that time was bureaucracy - software and internet were new things yet and nobody knew exactly how to manage software engineers. 

That's probably because long before the internet boom and the explosion of companies doing software for the most different reasons, the management theories that dominated universities and companies were all based in the reality of car manufacturing factories. No surprise, the concept of "Software Factory" was really popular at that time. That caused many management theories to be based on designing everything first (like designing a car), then implementing it (manufacturing).

The idea never worked for software development, as usually the problem is completely different, you won't produce the same code 1000s of times, each software project is different and it's meant to be done just once. Also, if you create a car which requires much maintenance, nobody will buy it any more and it will get a bad fame in the market. That wouldn't happen with software, as every software is custom, and I saw many companies profiting from doing a bad job - the more maintenance software required, more your customer would depend on you. 

Then it came [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/). A completely different mental model that was very welcome in the market where you give more value to the humans in your team than to the processes you follow, designing the whole software upfront (waterfall model) was replaced by interactive processes, and architects and managers which defined everything and that thought that the main job of a software engineer was to right code were slowly replaced in the market by managers which would abdicate control of the team in favour of delegating more to the team members. 

The concept of architect was slowly replaced by the concept of team lead, with Y career progression paths to staff / principal software engineer, where the role wouldn't be defining every piece of the software, but to motivate and lead the team by turning them into more independent team members, who could make decisions by themselves. 

All those changes in software development world came together with a set of political and lifestyle changes world wide, where thanks to internet, people could collaborate more to each other online, more participative methods were created where people who could never participate on decisions now could have a voice, through social media, influencing skills and much easier access to information. 

I remember being on a software team near 2010 where we were discussing About big data tools and comparing [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) and [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/), and the main arguments in the team defending the first was that it was fully distributed, while the second had leader election based in Zookeeper where there would still be a central point. Although we were talking about technical data tool, it was embedded in everyone's mind at that time that "centralized is bad, distributed is good". You didn't have to argue much, just defending de-centralization was usually enough to convince people whatever was the subject, being software, politics, or whatever.

This makes sense if you understand the moment - we were coming from a world with little or no decentralization and our minds were biased towards it. But what happened later? 

## Where we are right now

In world politics, I won't dig into details, but you probably already know decentralization started showing its flaws - it's harder to control fake news dissemination, extremists gained voice all over the world, and losing central control on critical things had critical consequences, such as people using the flaws of de-centralization to install dictatorships, with the facade of anarchism. 

In the world of software engineering, I would say we have started seems similar flaws as well.
